## Report Gallery

The previous examples in the **reporter** documentation were intentionally
simplified to focus on the workings of a particular function.  It is helpful,
however, to also view **reporter** functions in the context of a complete 
program.  There is a gallery of examples included in the 
[sassy](https://sassy.r-sassy.org) package that illustrate
how **reporter** functions work together with other **sassy** functions to
create a complete report.  You can find the report gallery 
[here](https://sassy.r-sassy.org/articles/sassy.html).
